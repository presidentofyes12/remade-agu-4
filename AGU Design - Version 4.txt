Ensure that you use only the contracts below - do not create a new one:

 Contract Addresses
VITE_CONTRACT_CONCEPT_VALUES=0xbabf5c0170339814D17f31Ed4198557E4fd92C58
VITE_CONTRACT_CONCEPT_MAPPING=0xE02894B878Eb424037C151b840C1db6Fde7Dec1e
VITE_CONTRACT_TRIPARTITE_COMPUTATIONS=0x500E4ce4592051f8005e1313f0e9aB25aE43E0e3
VITE_CONTRACT_DAO_TOKEN=0x28692ce06b9EB38a8b4D07FED172ba5c3403745b
VITE_CONTRACT_LOGIC_CONSTITUENT=0xdd7eC040D5C2A15FFF30a5F7B004d888747Fa903
VITE_CONTRACT_STATE_CONSTITUENT=0xE24C734260189dd58618A95619EfF4164f98CC78
VITE_CONTRACT_VIEW_CONSTITUENT=0x2F2af46ae41ABEA5c3D8A50289d2b326D657a689
VITE_CONTRACT_TRIPARTITE_PROXY=0xfBDB056Ac097EbB399065aeAd2375A2dAEE33731

These contracts have been deployed and verified.
Now I have a complete picture of the contract system:

1. Core Contracts:
- DAOToken: Handles membership and economic aspects
- StateConstituent: Manages DAO state, proposals, and vouching
- LogicConstituent: Validates operations and handles logic
- ViewConstituent: Provides read-only views of DAO data

2. Proxy and Upgrades:
- TripartiteProxy: Main proxy contract managing upgrades
- Handles contract upgrades and access control

3. Concept System:
- ConceptMapping: Defines and manages DAO concepts
- ConceptValues: Stores and manages concept values
- TripartiteComputations: Handles value computations

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

    Do NOT modify any existing smart contract code
    Do NOT change any contract interfaces or ABIs
    Keep all existing web3/crypto functionality intact
    Maintain all current dependencies and their versions
