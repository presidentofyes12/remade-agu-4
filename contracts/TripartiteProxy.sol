Rough draft- there are potential issues in the concepts below.

This system presents a cyclic model of interrelated concepts, where zero (2.13163E-14) and 100 form a complete circle, similar to 0 and 360 degrees. The numerical table contains 108 distinct values arranged in 12 cycles, with each cycle containing 9 sequential stages (8 progressive stages plus 1 integrative stage). These values mathematically encode relationships between concepts, where each concept is formed by the interaction of three other concepts.

A hierarchical classification system with 12 major categories, each containing 3 subcategories, and each subcategory having 3 components in parentheses:
For each category:
•	Number of subcategories (should be 3)
•	Number of components within each subcategory (should be 3)
•	
So the total structure is:
•	12 main categories
•	36 subcategories (12 × 3)
•	108 components in parentheses (36 × 3)
The categories seem to progress from fundamental physical sciences through increasingly complex and abstract domains, culminating in integrative and universal concepts. The system appears to be attempting to create a comprehensive organizational framework for different domains of knowledge and understanding.

DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE RIGHT REASON (Ethical intent + Positive outcome)
•	None of the listed behaviors fall here as they all involve knowing harm
DOING THE WRONG THING FOR THE RIGHT REASON (Unethical means + Intended positive outcome)
1.	Urban development displacing communities "for greater good"
2.	Experimental medical testing without consent "to advance science"
3.	Environmental exploitation "for economic development"
4.	Manipulating public opinion "to prevent panic"
5.	Academic fraud "to help struggling students"
DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE WRONG REASON (Ethical action + Self-serving intent)
1.	Whistleblowing for personal gain
2.	Environmental compliance only to avoid fines
3.	Safety protocols followed only to avoid liability
4.	Food safety maintained only for profit
5.	Privacy protection only for market advantage
DOING THE WRONG THING FOR THE WRONG REASON (Unethical means + Self-serving intent)
1.	Medical exploitation for profit
2.	Data exploitation for personal gain
3.	Market manipulation for wealth
4.	Identity theft for financial gain
5.	Resource exploitation for profit
6.	Food adulteration for cost savings

Doing the wrong thing (action) for the wrong reason (intention)


ACTION WITH INTENTION:
1.	Doing the right thing (action) for the right reason (intention)
•	Stopping a malicious hacker to protect public safety
•	Clear protective action with ethical intent
2.	Doing the wrong thing (action) for the right reason (intention)
•	Hacking to expose dangerous security flaws
•	Harmful action with beneficial intent
3.	Doing the right thing (action) for the wrong reason (intention)
•	Following safety protocols only to avoid lawsuits
•	Correct action with self-serving intent
4.	Doing the wrong thing (action) for the wrong reason (intention)
•	Creating malware for financial theft
•	Harmful action with malicious intent
INTENTION WITHOUT ACTION: 
5. Right intention without action
•	Wanting to stop wrongdoing but failing to act
•	Good intent paralyzed by fear/circumstance
6.	Wrong intention without action
•	Desiring to harm but lacking opportunity
•	Malicious intent constrained by circumstances
ACTION WITHOUT INTENTION: 
7. Right action without intention
•	Accidentally preventing harm through unrelated actions
•	Beneficial outcome without purposeful intent
8.	Wrong action without intention
•	Accidentally causing harm through carelessness
•	Harmful outcome without malicious intent
Common patterns:
•	Action and intention can align or conflict
•	Lack of action doesn't negate moral weight of intention
•	Unintended consequences matter regardless of intent
•	Context shapes both action and intention
•	Impact can be independent of both action and intention
 
ESTABLISHED RATINGS (Given):
1.	Right action + Right intention = Good
2.	Wrong action + Right intention = Not Bad
3.	Right action + Wrong intention = Not Good
4.	Wrong action + Wrong intention = Bad
REVISED RATINGS:
5. Right intention + No action = Not Good (Good intentions without follow-through show moral awareness but lack of commitment)
6.	Wrong intention + No action = Bad (Having harmful intentions but lacking opportunity is morally equivalent to wrong action + wrong intention)
7.	Right action + No intention = Good (Beneficial outcomes regardless of intent still create positive impact)
8.	Wrong action + No intention = Not Good (Causing harm through carelessness shows lack of proper care)
